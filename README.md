# Cruddyapp

Test it out here: https://cruddyapp.web.app/

## Requirements

1. Use Angular (V12 or higher)
2. The application needs to be simple and should allow the user to fetch some data and perform operations on it.
3. The application needs to perform all the 4 CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
4. The API calls made should be reflected in the data being displayed in the front end.
   EG: Calling a POST request, should add another element to the data list being displayed.
5. It would be preferable for all the 4 operations to be performed on a single screen.(A simple way would be to use different buttons for each operation).
6. You may use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ or any similar site for imitating the GET, POST, PATCH/PUT, DELETE requests.
7. (Optional) Build and deploy it on Firebase or any other service.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.5.
