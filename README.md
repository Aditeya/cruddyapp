## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

## Requirements

1) Use Angular (V12 or higher)
2) The application needs to be simple and should allow the user to fetch some data and perform operations on it.
3) The application needs to perform all the 4 CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
4) The API calls made should be reflected in the data being displayed in the front end.
   EG: Calling a POST request, should add another element to the data list being displayed.
5) It would be preferable for all the 4 operations to be performed on a single screen.(A simple way would be to use different buttons for each operation).
5) You may use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ or any similar site for imitating the GET, POST, PATCH/PUT, DELETE requests.
6) (Optional) Build and deploy it on Firebase or any other service.
